				<h1>Song and Yuan dynasties (960–1368)</h1><h2>Chinese Painting</h2>
					<p>Painting during the Song Dynasty (960–1279) reached a new level of   sophistication with further development of landscape painting;   immeasurable distances were conveyed through the use of blurred   outlines, mountain contours disappearing into the mist, and   impressionistic treatment of natural phenomena. The <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shan_shui" target="_blank" title="Shan shui">shan shui</a></em> style painting—&quot;shan&quot; meaning mountain, and &quot;shui&quot; meaning river—became   prominent features in Chinese landscape art. The emphasis laid upon   landscape painting in the Song period was grounded in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_philosophy" target="_blank" title="Chinese philosophy">Chinese philosophy</a>; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoism" target="_blank" title="Taoism">Taoism</a> stressed that humans were but tiny specks amongst vast and greater cosmos, while <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Confucianist" target="_blank" title="Neo-Confucianist">Neo-Confucianist</a> writers often pursued the discovery of patterns and principles that they believed caused all social and natural phenomena. The painting of portraits and closely viewed objects like birds on   branches were held in high esteem by the Song Chinese, landscape   painting was paramount. By the beginning of the Song Dynasty a distinctive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Landscape_style" target="_blank" title="Northern Landscape style">landscape style</a> had emerged. Artists mastered the formula of creating intricate and realistic scenes   placed in the foreground, while the background retained qualities of   vast and infinite space. Distant mountain peaks rise out of high clouds   and mist, while streaming rivers run from afar into the foreground.</p>
					<p>There was a significant difference in painting trends between the   Northern Song period (960–1127) and Southern Song period (1127–1279).   The paintings of Northern Song officials were influenced by their   political ideals of bringing order to the world and tackling the largest   issues affecting the whole of their society, hence their paintings   often depicted huge, sweeping landscapes. On the other hand, Southern Song officials were more interested in   reforming society from the bottom up and on a much smaller scale, a   method they believed had a better chance for eventual success. Hence, their paintings often focused on smaller, visually closer, and   more intimate scenes, while the background was often depicted as bereft   of detail as a realm without substance or concern for the artist or   viewer. This change in attitude from one era to the next stemmed largely from the rising influence of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Confucianism" target="_blank" title="Neo-Confucianism">Neo-Confucian</a> philosophy. Adherents to Neo-Confucianism focused on reforming society   from the bottom up, not the top down, which can be seen in their efforts   to promote small private academies during the Southern Song instead of   the large state-controlled academies seen in the Northern Song era.</p>
					<p>Ever since the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_and_Northern_Dynasties" target="_blank" title="Southern and Northern Dynasties">Southern and Northern Dynasties</a> (420–589), painting had become an art of high sophistication that was   associated with the gentry class as one of their main artistic pastimes,   the others being calligraphy and poetry. During the Song Dynasty there were avid art collectors that would often   meet in groups to discuss their own paintings, as well as rate those of   their colleagues and friends. The poet and statesman <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Su_Shi" target="_blank" title="Su Shi">Su Shi</a> (1037–1101) and his accomplice <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mi_Fu" target="_blank" title="Mi Fu">Mi Fu</a> (1051–1107) often partook in these affairs, borrowing art pieces to   study and copy, or if they really admired a piece then an exchange was   often proposed.They created a new kind of art based upon the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_perfections" target="_blank" title="Three perfections">three perfections</a> in which they used their skills in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calligraphy" target="_blank" title="Calligraphy">calligraphy</a> (the art of beautiful writing) to make ink paintings. From their time   onward, many painters strove to freely express their feelings and to   capture the inner spirit of their subject instead of describing its   outward appearance. The small round paintings popular in the Southern   Song were often collected into albums as poets would write poems along   the side to match the theme and mood of the painting.</p>
