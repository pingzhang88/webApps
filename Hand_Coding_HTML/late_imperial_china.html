				<h1>Late imperial China (1368–1895)</h1>
				<h2>Chinese Painting</h2>
					<p>Beginning in the 13th century, the tradition of painting simple   subjects—a branch with fruit, a few flowers, or one or two   horses—developed. Narrative painting, with a wider color range and a   much busier composition than Song paintings, was immensely popular   during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming_Dynasty_painting" target="_blank" title="Ming Dynasty painting">Ming period</a> (1368–1644).</p>
					<p>The first books illustrated with colored woodcuts appeared around   this time; as color-printing techniques were perfected, illustrated   manuals on the art of painting began to be published. <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jieziyuan_Huazhuan" target="_blank" title="Jieziyuan Huazhuan">Jieziyuan Huazhuan</a> (Manual of the Mustard Seed Garden)</em>, a five-volume work first published in 1679, has been in use as a technical textbook for artists and students ever since.</p>
					<p>Some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming_Dynasty_painting" target="_blank" title="Ming Dynasty painting">painters of the Ming dynasty</a> (1368–1644) continued the traditions of the Yuan scholar-painters. This group of painters, known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_School" target="_blank" title="Wu School">Wu School</a>, was led by the artist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shen_Zhou" target="_blank" title="Shen Zhou">Shen Zhou</a>. Another group of painters, known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhe_School" target="_blank" title="Zhe School">Zhe School</a>, revived and transformed the styles of the Song court.</p>
					<p>During the early <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_Dynasty" target="_blank" title="Qing Dynasty">Qing Dynasty</a> (1644–1911), painters known as Individualists rebelled against many of   the traditional rules of painting and found ways to express themselves   more directly through free brushwork. In the 18th and 19th centuries,   great commercial cities such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangzhou" target="_blank" title="Yangzhou">Yangzhou</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai" target="_blank" title="Shanghai">Shanghai</a> became art centers where wealthy merchant-patrons encouraged artists to produce bold new works.</p>
					<p>In the late 19th and 20th centuries, Chinese painters were increasingly exposed to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_art_history" target="_blank" title="Western art history">Western art</a>.   Some artists who studied in Europe rejected Chinese painting; others   tried to combine the best of both traditions. Among the most beloved   modern painters was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi_Baishi" target="_blank" title="Qi Baishi">Qi Baishi</a>, who began life as a poor peasant and became a great master. His best known works depict flowers and small animals.</p>
