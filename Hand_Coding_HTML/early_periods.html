				<h1>Early Periods Chinese Painting</h1>
					<p>The earliest paintings were not representational but ornamental; they   consisted of patterns or designs rather than pictures. Early pottery   was painted with spirals, zigzags, dots, or animals. It was only during the <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warring_States_Period" target="_blank" id="warring">Warring States Period</a></strong> (475-221 BC) that artists began to represent the world around them. In imperial times (beginning with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jin_Dynasty_%28265%E2%80%93420%29" target="_blank">Eastern Jin Dynasty</a>), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Painting" target="_blank">painting</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calligraphy" target="_blank" title="Calligraphy">calligraphy</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China" target="_blank" title="China">China</a> were among the most highly appreciated arts in the court and they were   often practiced by amateurs—aristocrats and scholar-officials—who had   the leisure time necessary to perfect the technique and sensibility   necessary for great brushwork. Calligraphy and painting were thought to   be the purest forms of art. The implements were the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ink_brush" target="_blank" title="Ink brush">brush pen</a>, made of animal hair, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_ink" target="_blank" title="Indian ink">black inks</a> made from pine soot and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_glue" target="_blank" title="Animal glue">animal glue</a>. In ancient times, writing, as well as painting, was done on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk" target="_blank" title="Silk">silk</a>. However, after the invention of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper" target="_blank" title="Paper">paper</a> in the 1st century AD, silk was gradually replaced by the new and   cheaper material. Original writings by famous calligraphers have been   greatly valued throughout China's history and are mounted on scrolls and   hung on walls in the same way that paintings are.</p>
					<p>Artists from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Dynasty" target="_blank" title="Han Dynasty">Han</a> (206 BC - 220 AD) to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tang_Dynasty" target="_blank" title="Tang Dynasty">Tang</a> (618–906) dynasties mainly painted the human figure. Much of what we   know of early Chinese figure painting comes from burial sites, where   paintings were preserved on silk banners, lacquered objects, and tomb   walls. Many early tomb paintings were meant to protect the dead or help   their souls get to paradise. Others illustrated the teachings of the   Chinese philosopher <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucius" target="_blank" title="Confucius">Confucius</a>, or showed scenes of daily life.</p>
